/* 	This contains a file with my to do list for this project:

	-Add home screen
		-> allow user to select which of sueda's simulations to watch #
			-(by picture on a cube or something)
		-> allow user to select an empty scene where they can just draw galaxies
		-> fix calcMovement class (or write another simple one)

	-In simulation:
		-> allow user to change star color, star mass, start size?
		-> allow user change input method: 
			-throwing
			-streaming
			-shooting
			-currently have: drawing


	-Rendering particles as sprite instead of particles
		-> learn about this
		-> can change the size?
		-> find images for them


	Maybe:
		-Play around with geometry shader to add a stream (tail?)
		-Allow player to attach themself to a star

	
	*** Performance enhancement idea...
	


	Home Screen {
		-start off with 5 boxes
			-> use left/right on controller (or keyboard) to go in between them
			-> if press 'a' (or something on keyboard) to select a scene
				-> on press A, load a new scene
				-> pass to new scene: Galaxy data string name 
			-> if press back
				-> do nothing
	
		newScene load:
			-> if press back (middle trigger) then go back to home screen

	

	Monday:
	-switch between option using joypad
	-automatically start simulation, in the place that gives the best view
	-on home screen add fog and darken skybox
	-add music
		-> sound on diff clicks
		-> general music playing
	-cool way of showing which galaxy is currently being clicked

	*delete enough stuff so that I can use unity cloud version control again

	}
