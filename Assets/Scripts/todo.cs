 	This contains a file with my to do list for this project:
	
	ToDo() {
		AddHomeScreen() {
			-> allow user to select which of sueda's simulations to watch (DONE)
				-(by picture on a cube or something) (DONE)
			-> allow user to select an empty scene where they can just draw galaxies
			-> fix calcMovement class (or write another simple one) (DONE)
		}

		InSimulation() {
			-> if press back (middle trigger) then go back to home screen (DONE)
			-> switch between galaxy options using arrow keys, and some kind of VR input
			-> allow user to change star color, star mass, start size?
			-> allow user change input method: 
				-throwing
				-streaming
				-shooting
				-currently have: drawing
		}


		-Rendering particles as sprite instead of particles
			-> learn about this
			-> can change the size?
			-> find images for them


		Maybe:
			-Play around with geometry shader to add a stream (tail?)
			-Allow player to attach themself to a star

		
		*** Performance enhancement idea...
	}


	Curr() {
		-fix size of sprites so they are all the same size (DONE)
		-switch between option using joypad (DONE)
		-automatically start simulation (DONE)
		-start in the place that gives the best view (DONE)
		-on home screen:
			-> add fog (DONE)
			-> darken skybox (DONE)
		-add music
			-> sound on diff clicks
			-> general music playing
		-cool way of showing which galaxy is currently being clicked

		*delete enough stuff so that I can use unity cloud version control again
		
		
	}





	Fnished() {
		HomeScreen() {
			-start off with 5 boxes (DONE)
				-> use left/right on controller (or keyboard) to go in between them (DONE)
				-> if press 'a' (or something on keyboard) to select a scene (DONE)
					-> on press A, load a new scene (DONE)
					-> pass to new scene: Galaxy data string name (DONE) 
				-> if press back (DONE)
					-> do nothing (DONE)
		}
